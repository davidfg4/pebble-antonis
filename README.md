This is a recreation of Victor's Watch from "Cosmos Laundromat: First Cycle". Go watch it if you haven't seen it! This watch shows hours on the left, minutes on the right, and seconds in the middle. (This watch is primarily designed to match the fictional watch, and not be 100% useful. So the colors may be hard to see and the hour and minute hands do not have directional indicators.)
